I've participated in numerous projects during the Piscine, including the Rush projects and the BSQ. Although we failed some of them, I'm really grateful for the great time I had and the friends I've made during them. 

# PROJECTS

I've decided to upload my projects to GitHub so more students across the globe can benefit from them, just like how I did.

**WARNING:** I was far from being a perfect student and some of my works here are not their best kind. Don't copy them blindly! First, read and analyze them and come up with a better version of them. This way, you can also learn from them and won't have to retry the projects, in situations where the code is outdated and couldn't pass the tests of Moulinette.
